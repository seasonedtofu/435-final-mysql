-------q2------------Provide a simple description of your schema (10 points)---------REQUIRED
Instead of E-R Diagram, use the notation below to describe your design
Use only text and represent a table as S(Name,SID*,Age,Gender,cell) where S is a table and it has
5 columns and SID is a primary key attribute, indicated by *.
Course(CID*,Title,dept,Crhr) is another.
and E(SID+,CID+)
here the table E has two attributes SID and CID and both
 are foreign key as indicated by +
You can specify the FK relationships as follows:
        CID(Course,E) according to the convention FK(PK Table,FK Table)
Cardinality of the relationships may be specified as follows:
1to1(E,Course) and 1toM(Course,E)
1to1(S,Course) and 1toM(S,E)
No need to draw anything just text ...
